## Reminder
The tool is call Restream Hacking (=ReHack) but it don't attempt to do negatif stuffs.  
Hacking just means put your hand in the code and do stuffs that was not intended to be used for.  

The only purpuse of this tools are:  
- to provide the Restream community a way to create better tools for their community.  
- to provide the Restream platform more users as the tool is kind of amazingly usefull.  

The code of my library are under ["Eloi Donation license"](https://eloistree.page.link/license).  
**But don't forget that if your use of the Restream tool in commercial way, you need to talk about it direclty with the [Restream Team](https://restream.io/).**  
  
Hope my code is useful to you.   
May the code be with you.
